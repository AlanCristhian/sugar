Python 3 functional programing experiments.

## Abandoned

I drop this project because:
- The special lambda function are hard to debug.
- The library have too many hacks to work and the implementation is unintuitive.
- If ocur an error, the traceback will show the information in the mapped
  function.
- Don't have a good way to implement generators, coroutines or async functions.
- Don't support a ful python expression. E.g. if/else expression, or/and
  operators.
- The most simple real life function looks ugly and is hard to understand.
- There are only few cases that can benefit with recursivity.
- Nested functions are less redable.
- Functional programming is not a good idea in general.
